<h1>BlankPress WordPress Theme</h1>

<p>Just another blank starter theme for WordPress projects.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>BlankPress requires the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To create a new project:</p>

<p><code>
cd path/to/your/project
git clone git@github.com:geoffgraham/BlankPress.git
mv BlankPress your-project-directory
</code></p>

<p>This repository includes a full WordPress installation in addition to the theme files. Update <code>wp-config.php</code> and complete the WordPress installation like you would for any other WordPress site.</p>

<p>If you just want the theme files, then it might be easier to download the full repository ZIP file, extract the theme from <code>wp-content/themes/BlankPress</code> and drop it into your project.</p>

<h2>Bourbon</h2>

<p>This theme uses <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Bourbon Neat</a> for the layout grid. Neat requires Bourbon, so that means there are a ton of SASS mixins and functions included in this package right out of the box. Refer to the <a href="http://bourbon.io/docs/">Bourbon docs</a> for more info on usage.</p>

<p>Bourbon files are located in <code>wp-content/themes/BlankPress/lib/styles/scss/vendor</code>.</p>

<h2>File Structure</h2>

<p>This theme is structured with the following component files located in <code>wp-content/themes/BlankPress/lib</code>.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>All functions have been split up and by their respective function. The are located in <code>wp-content/themes/BlankPress/lib</code> and imported by <code>wp-content/themes/BlankPress/functions.php</code>.</p>

<p>If you need additional functionality (which is likely), I would recommend creating a new file and importing it into <code>functions.php</code> using the <code>require_once</code> method.</p>

<h3>Stylesheets</h3>

<p>All styles are properly enqueued by <code>lib/functions/enqueue_styles.php</code>.</p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<p>All Javascript for the theme is enqueued by WordPress in <code>lib/functions/enqueue-scripts.php</code>. You can add your own scripts to <code>js/</code> and enqueue them the same way. This is the method recommended by WordPress.</p>
